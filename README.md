# About me
My Personal Repository    
<!--

Hi! I am a 3rd year student from BITS PILANI pursuing Msc. Mathematics and B.E. CS
My hobbies include watching cricket and playing chess. 
I am also an avid movie/Tv show watcher and a show I would recommend to anyone reading this is Umbrella Academy on Netflix.

I am just starting out on coding (I know its too late now. I am already in my 3rd year but hey its never too late) 
Currently I am focused on learning Python and its various libraries including NumPy and MathPlotLib. 
I am also trying to learn MATLAB though I have no idea how useful it will be :)

Wish Me Luck
